- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I am Romain Pintore
- ðŸ¦– I am a Data Scientist with a research background (former Palaeobiologist, PhD with 7+ years of experience).
- ðŸŒ± Over the last 7 years, I have specialized in machine learning approaches (such as dimensionality reduction, clustering and modeling) in order to predict how dinosaurs walked based on large datasets of 3D fossil bones!
- ðŸ‘€ I am now looking to collaborate on new Data Science projects where I could transpose my research experience into more operational problematics.
